# create-express-api

Do you know how easy it is to create a new react app with the create-react-app command? 

Now you can create an easy API with express, layers, mysql connection and some tests. All you have to do is 

`npm i --global @joaobuzato/create-express-api`

And inside a root folder you run 
`npx run create-react-app myProjectName`

It's done! 

To make the project run, you only need to create and .env file on the root of the project, with the database credentials.

//.env

```
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=3306
DB_USERNAME=username
DB_PASSWORD=password
```
