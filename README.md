# create-express-api

This project is a boilerplate to build an api with express JS, including the connection to mysql, tests, and other things.

To make the project run, you only need to create and .env file on the root of the project, with the database credentials.

//.env

```
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=3306
DB_USERNAME=username
DB_PASSWORD=password
```
